**The problem is** to model and present the resource savings possible by setting a server room's time-programmable thermostat to a cooler temperature during hours when the electrical supply tariff is off-peak.

**The users are** server room operators in general and work colleagues who maintain the environment of two server rooms.

**I will find out more** by investigating available weather forecasts, utility tiers and server rooms in the local area. I will also study the critical thermal modelling characteristics and related calculus.

**The skills I will be using from level 3** will be delivering a software engineering project in an agile fashion (TM354).

**The professional skills I will be using** will be web development and data science.

**The progress beyond level 3** will be combining existing skills and mathematical modelling techniques to solve a relevant and practical problem.

**The end product I will deliver** will be a thermal management model, recommendation algorithm and presentation website. This system should fetch its data from APIs and a site survey.

**I could extend the scope** by integrating with a thermostat API, graphing the expected room temperatures, guiding the estimation of server room thermal properties, bundling for deployment as an IoT device, and extending the model to domestic and commercial use.
