Hello both,

As you know, for my final year university project I am modelling whether resource savings are possible by proactively cooling server rooms during cheaper tariffs. I've previously secured your permission-in-principle to use the BDX as a case study, but I now need to turn this into some specific permissions. I understand that negotiations will be required with the BDX board, so this is more of a introductory note than a polished pitch.

The most controversial permission I'd like is to know how quickly the BDX reacts to a change in thermostat, which will let me know how much energy can be stored in the materials of the room. This can be either be gathered directly by adjusting the thermostat a degree or two, or it can be estimated passively by performing a detailed survey of the room and equipment. I'd also like to confirm how the air handling systems interact and to know how hard the air cooling systems work during routine operations.

Any help is appreciated,

Thanks, Andrew.

Hi ANdrew,

## [23/03/2022 09:17] Simon O'Hare

I was expecting to raise this at a BDX meeting yesterday which was cancelled

## [23/03/2022 09:18] Simon O'Hare

I'm certain you'd be able to get stuck into the BDX for these purposes and I'd be very happy to have a Curve person more clued up on all aspects of the BDX BMS etc

## [23/03/2022 09:21] Simon O'Hare

I'll do an intro to Leo, James and George who all have knowledge in the BDX and form the informal ops group for it. I'd be very happy for you to be embedded in that group and get stuck into the technical running of the BDX if you so desire

## [23/03/2022 09:24] Simon O'Hare

James is Technical Director for Fastnet and is in charge of their datacentres. George is Tech Director at Xoomtalk and manages after their DC/tech and Leo runs Globalreach and various other tech related things. They all have a lot of DC experience and knowledge

## [23/03/2022 09:33] Simon O'Hare

As discussed, please be aware that there are some issues of corporate confidentiality working with these three companies (semi competitors) and also opportunities to be conscious of if we work in partnership with them. It's a bit of a balancing act, but get stuck in and if you have any query or uncertainty just give me a shout

## [23/03/2022 09:36] Andrew Lucas

Thanks for that Simon, will look forwards to the introduction.

Hi Chaps,

I’d like to introduce one of our brilliant techs, Andrew, who is completing his final year of a degree course. He would like to use the BDX as part of a final year project. Please could you take a look at what he’d like to do and see if you’re happy for him to proceed? If you are, would you be able to support him in the project?

Apart from anything else, I think it will be positive to have another tech onboard who is familiar in the BDX BMS and systems.

Andrew’s request to me –

“As you know, for my final year university project I am modelling whether resource savings are possible by proactively cooling server rooms during cheaper tariffs.

If you have any concerns, please let me know. If not, I’ll let Andrew follow up with you on BMS access etc.

Many thanks

Simon O’Hare

Hi Simon

Belated response (sorry) to say this is good and happy to work with Andrew.

Shaun

Hi,

Thanks for the response Shaun. Is there a convenient time when we could get together, complete as many of the quick-wins as we can, and consider the longer task of the thermal survey.

My calendar is fairly flexible, so I’ll let you be the first to put dates forward.

Thanks, Andrew.

## From: Andrew Lucas, Sent: 04 May 2022 10:31, To: Shaun Fensom, Simon O'Hare, Subject: RE: BDX Cooling project / BMS

Hi Shaun,

Did you get my previous email? I’m looking to get a few moments confirming how the air circulation systems interact and what the walls are made of, then permission and credentials to monitor the temperature when the thermostat is dropped by a couple of degrees.

## From: Simon O'Hare, Sent: 04 May 2022 10:40, To: Andrew Lucas, Shaun Fensom, Leo Brown, James Parker, Subject: RE: BDX Cooling project / BMS

Hi Andrew,

Leo and James would be best placed to answer this query for you.

@Leo Brown, @James Parker are you able to assist Andrew?

Many thanks!

Simon

Hi Simon, Andrew

Apologies Andrew. Your email has been sitting in a vast pile.

Thanks Simon, that makes much more sense.

Shaun

Hi Leo, James

Are either of you in a place to be able to help me get a survey done? I’m not expecting that it’ll take more than 30 minutes of your time, and after that I’ll do a small batch of more time-intensive work.

Thanks, Andrew.

Hi

That’s fine – Monday OK?

## From: Andrew Lucas, Sent: 09 Jul 2022, To: Leo Brown

Since starting this project my calendar has actually become a lot more restrictive because I’ve taken a part-time job in a school. I can either be available Fridays, or on other days by arrangement.

Sorry, forgot to update the thread.

## From: Leo Brown, Sent: 09 Jul 2022, To: Andrew Lucas

Hi

Friday a also fine

## From: Andrew Lucas, Sent: 11 Jul 2022, To: Leo Brown

Excellent. I shall head into the office on Friday. Is there any time that is better for you? I’d like early (but not too early) because there’s a decent chance I’ll be able to get a chunk of work done after our meeting.

## From: Leo Brown, Sent 11 Jul 2022, To: Andrew Lucas

Hi

9am would be ideal.

## From: Andrew Lucas, Sent: 11 Jul 2022, To: Leo Brown

Excellent, see you then.

My hopes for the meeting are to check my understanding of the air handling systems in the BDX and then get the credentials required to lower the thermostat by a degree or two.

## From: Leo Brown, Sent: 11 Jul 2022, To: Andrew Lucas

Hi

The A/C password is ------, you can change the setpoint on the LCD.

But I’ll let you in and if I have time stay and chat.

I think possibly one of them is set to 20 and one to 19.

Freecooling may be in action and I may not be able to disable. I’ll try to get someone else over too.

## From: Leo Brown, Sent: 11 Jul 2022, To: Andrew Lucas

Hi Andrew,

Are you at New England House?

## From: Andrew Lucas, Sent 15 Jul 2022, To: Leo Brown

I am, yes. Currently sat at my desk in the Curve IT office.

## From: Leo Brown, Sent: 15 Jul 2022, To: Andrew Lucas

Understood, well I’ll meet you outside the BDX at 09:45 then…

## From: Andrew Lucas, Sent: 15 Jul 2022, To: Leo Brown

Sounds good, see you soon.

## Survey Meeting, Date: 15 Jul 2022, Present: Andrew Lucas, Leo Brown

Confirmed access to BDX and limits of survey permissions.

Discussed limitations imposed by equipment under maintenance.

Agreed to delay survey.

## From: Andrew Lucas, Sent: 22 Jul 2022, To: Leo Brown

Hi Leo,

Did the room integrity tests and maintenance on the FreeCool vents on Monday go well?

If they did then I’ll visit to perform the survey, although this shouldn’t require your presence if you don’t want to. I’ll keep you updated so it can be linked with the security logs, etc.

## From: Leo Brown, Sent: 22 Jul 2022, To: Andrew Lucas

Hi

Yes, the vents are now closed and integrity test passed.

There is a logic problem where freecooling would never work.

Knock yourself out.

## From: Andrew Lucas, Sent: 22 Jul 2022, To: Leo Brown

Interesting use of the present tense “is” regarding the freecooling, for what could be a fairly simple logic statement. I think the logic resolves to “if the desired temperature and the outside temperature are the same side of the inside temperature then the vents should be open”. This covers “we want it cooler and the outside is cooler” as well as the unlikely event of “we want it warmer and the outside is warmer”.

Did you have a chance to double-check whether cold aisle racks should be blanked off where there aren’t servers? I think they should be, as evidenced by the sealed-air door to the walkway.

Thanks for the go-ahead.

## From: Leo Brown, Sent: 22 Jul 2022, To: Andrew Lucas

Hi

The problem is the temperature sensor is inside the unit, so while running believes outside is 17deg.

The racks should have blanking plates. We failed to source them I think.

## From: Andrew Lucas, Sent: 11 Aug 2022, To: Leo Brown

On my way in to do the survey now. As discussed, I don’t need anyone else there I’m just letting you know in case activity logs need lining up.
