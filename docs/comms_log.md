Hello both,

As you know, for my final year university project I am modelling whether resource savings are possible by proactively cooling server rooms during cheaper tariffs. I've previously secured your permission-in-principle to use the BDX as a case study, but I now need to turn this into some specific permissions. I understand that negotiations will be required with the BDX board, so this is more of a introductory note than a polished pitch.

The most controversial permission I'd like is to know how quickly the BDX reacts to a change in thermostat, which will let me know how much energy can be stored in the materials of the room. This can be either be gathered directly by adjusting the thermostat a degree or two, or it can be estimated passively by performing a detailed survey of the room and equipment. I'd also like to confirm how the air handling systems interact and to know how hard the air cooling systems work during routine operations.

Any help is appreciated,

Thanks, Andrew.

Hi ANdrew,

## [23/03/2022 09:17] Simon O'Hare

I was expecting to raise this at a BDX meeting yesterday which was cancelled

## [23/03/2022 09:18] Simon O'Hare

I'm certain you'd be able to get stuck into the BDX for these purposes and I'd be very happy to have a Curve person more clued up on all aspects of the BDX BMS etc

## [23/03/2022 09:21] Simon O'Hare

I'll do an intro to Leo, James and George who all have knowledge in the BDX and form the informal ops group for it. I'd be very happy for you to be embedded in that group and get stuck into the technical running of the BDX if you so desire

## [23/03/2022 09:24] Simon O'Hare

James is Technical Director for Fastnet and is in charge of their datacentres. George is Tech Director at Xoomtalk and manages after their DC/tech and Leo runs Globalreach and various other tech related things. They all have a lot of DC experience and knowledge

As discussed, please be aware that there are some issues of corporate confidentiality working with these three companies (semi competitors) and also opportunities to be conscious of if we work in partnership with them. It's a bit of a balancing act, but get stuck in and if you have any query or uncertainty just give me a shout

## [23/03/2022 09:36] Andrew Lucas

Thanks for that Simon, will look forwards to the introduction.

Hi Chaps,

I’d like to introduce one of our brilliant techs, Andrew, who is completing his final year of a degree course. He would like to use the BDX as part of a final year project. Please could you take a look at what he’d like to do and see if you’re happy for him to proceed? If you are, would you be able to support him in the project?

Apart from anything else, I think it will be positive to have another tech onboard who is familiar in the BDX BMS and systems.

Andrew’s request to me –

“As you know, for my final year university project I am modelling whether resource savings are possible by proactively cooling server rooms during cheaper tariffs.

If you have any concerns, please let me know. If not, I’ll let Andrew follow up with you on BMS access etc.

Many thanks

Simon O’Hare

Hi Simon

Belated response (sorry) to say this is good and happy to work with Andrew.

Shaun

Hi,

Thanks for the response Shaun. Is there a convenient time when we could get together, complete as many of the quick-wins as we can, and consider the longer task of the thermal survey.

My calendar is fairly flexible, so I’ll let you be the first to put dates forward.

Thanks, Andrew.

Hi Shaun,

Did you get my previous email? I’m looking to get a few moments confirming how the air circulation systems interact and what the walls are made of, then permission and credentials to monitor the temperature when the thermostat is dropped by a couple of degrees.

Hi Andrew,

Leo and James would be best placed to answer this query for you.

@Leo Brown, @James Parker are you able to assist Andrew?

Many thanks!

Simon

Hi Simon, Andrew

Apologies Andrew. Your email has been sitting in a vast pile.

Thanks Simon, that makes much more sense.

Shaun

Hi Leo, James

Are either of you in a place to be able to help me get a survey done? I’m not expecting that it’ll take more than 30 minutes of your time, and after that I’ll do a small batch of more time-intensive work.

Thanks, Andrew.
