## About

As part of my OU degree, I am developing a website to reduce the resource consumption of server rooms.
It will do this by recommending alternative thermostat schedules that perform more of the cooling during cheaper hours.
This could represent a saving in currency or greenhouse gas emissions, depending on what is measured. 
As part of this, I want to assess how general the simplifications adopted in my model are.

This survey is intended for those familiar with a particular server room but does not require in-depth knowledge or reconfiguration of the room.

The final section of the survey asks about any other notes. I would ask you to complete this with any relevant observations I may have forgotten to ask about during the main survey.

## Geography

Where is the server room surveyed?

Even just a country and postcode area would be very useful for me to be able to reference relevant climate records

What is the area of the floor?

2-6 m^2 (a small single bedroom) / 6-20 m^2 (a double bedroom) / 20-60 m^2 (a small shop) / 200-600 m^2 (a medium shop) / Other

What is the surface area of external walls?

0-2 m^2 (insignificant or small surfaces) / 2-6 m^2 (one wall of a single bedroom) / 6-20 m^2 (a large lounge wall) / 20-60 m^2 (a small shop front) / 60-200 m^2 (a medium shop front) / Other

What is the surface area of internal walls?

0-2 m^2 (insignificant or small surfaces) / 2-6 m^2 (three walls of a large cupboard) / 6-20 m^2 (three walls of a single bedroom) / 20-60 m^2 (three walls of a large lounge) / 60-200 m^2 (three walls of a small shop) / 200-600 m^2 (three walls of a medium shop) / Other

## Server equipment

Approximately how many U of active equipment is being observed?

What changes to usage are experienced by the server equipment?

Scheduled overnight backup / High intensity operations (e.g. rendering) / Scheduled low-power mode / Demand-based low-power mode / No significant changes to server usage

Does the server room contain any other significant sources of heat?

## Cooling equipment

How well circulated is the air in the room?

Mostly passive convection / Significant active circulation / Designed air circulation (e.g. targeted ducting) / Other

What air circulation is present in most racks?

Active rack ventilation / Hot and cold aisles / Precision cooling / Other

What level of redundancy is present in the cooling equipment?

Available cooling approximately matches the required cooling (e.g. a single A/C that is usually active) / Available cooling exceeds the required cooling (e.g. a single A/C that is often inactive or 3 A/Cs with 2 active) / Available cooling significantly exceeds the required cooling (e.g. 2 A/Cs with one active) / Other

## External surfaces

Which construction techniques form a significant part of the external surfaces of the server room?

Single pane glazing / Double pane glazing / High insulation glazing / Uninsulated walls / Insulated walls (clad, cavity-filled or any other technique) / Other

How much midday sun does the room receive?

Almost all of the wall is glazed (e.g. wall-of-glass architecture) / Significant portions of the wall is glazed (e.g. office windows) / About half of the wall is glazed (e.g. domestic architecture) / A small portion of the wall is glazed (e.g. half basement architecture) / None of the wall is glazed (e.g. full basement architecture) / The relevant wall has a passive thermal overhang (e.g. PassivHaus architecture) / Other

How much general sun does the room receive?

Almost all of the walls are glazed (e.g. wall-of-glass architecture) / Significant portions of the walls are glazed (e.g. office windows) / About half of the wall is glazed (e.g. domestic architecture) / A small portion of the wall is glazed (e.g. half basement architecture) / None of the wall is glazed (e.g. full basement architecture) / Other

## Internal surfaces

Which construction techniques form a significant part of the internal walls around the server room?

Single pane glazing / Stud wall / Block wall / Other

How warm is the server room compared to the surrounding internal spaces?

Significantly cooler (3 or more degrees cooler) / A bit cooler (1 or 2 degrees cooler) / About the same (a degree either way) / A bit warmer (1 or 2 degrees warmer) / Significantly warmer (3 or more degrees warmer)

## Other notes

Please detail below any observations of the server room that I have forgotten to ask about.

If you are willing to be contact about testing the final survey, please put some contact details below.

Thank you!
