# Roadmap

## Backlog

* A customer should benefit from a sophisticated schedule optimisation algorithm.
* A customer should be able to model rooms with significant passive cooling.
* A technician could integrate this with live data from weather forecasts.
* A technician could integrate this with live data from electricity tariffs.
* A developer could use this model and algorithm in a smart thermostat.
* A technician could use this system to control a smart thermostat.
* A commercial environment could use this system.
* A domestic environment could use this system.
* A customer could be given a set of suggestions to improve their thermal properties.
* A technician should be able to enjoy the interface on a laptop (mid-resolution and KVM inputs).

## Priorities

* A technician must have a good understanding of the generalisability of the simplifications.
* A developer must be able to rely on a set of UX tests.

## Done

* A technician should have information on an example server room available.
* A customer must receive the predicted thermal changes of a room.
* A technician must be able to gather thermal observations of a server room.
* A technician must be able to input a baseline thermostat schedule.
* A technician must be able to input an electricity tariff schedule.
* A technician must be able to generate an optimised thermostat schedule.
* A technician must be able to generate a business-oriented report.

## Qualitative

* A technician could use this system without installation.
* A customer should be able to understand how the system processes data.
* A technician should be able to use this system despite accessibility challenges.
* A technician could use this system on a low-resolution touchscreen interface, such as a smartphone.
* A customer should be able to trace and test the model used in a report.
